# MODS

[Sharkfin](https://github.com/KayosMaker/Sailfin-Extruder/tree/main/Usermods/KayosMaker/Sharkfin)

Sharkfin is a slightly reimagined Sailfin.  These mods were more to satisfy my own neurosis, than actually being strictly necessary.  My goals were as follows: 
* alter the motor location so that a spacer isn't needed to mount the extruder on Mantis
* move the motor enough so that the extruder mounting screw and lower motor mounting screw do not interfere with each other
* lengthen tension arm slightly so it's actually possible to move it with your thumb while its mounted in the tight space on Mantis
* add 3rd screw to front piece, so both the tension arm pivot and the driven gear are supported on both sides
* maintain sailfin motor mounting angle, so pcb mounting brackets made for sailfin work on sharkfin as well
* NEW: Bondtech RIDGA support.  cad and stls in the sharkfin folders

[Sailfin for Voron Heat Inserts](https://github.com/KayosMaker/Sailfin-Extruder/tree/main/Usermods/KayosMaker/Sailfin_for_Voron_heat_inserts)

Sailfin for Voron heat inserts is just that.  It's a very minorly finessed stock Sailfin with holes altered to fit our standard heatsert in Voron land.  I like to debadge things so I also did that while I was at it.  

[PCB Mount](https://github.com/KayosMaker/Sailfin-Extruder/tree/main/Usermods/KayosMaker/Sailfin_PCB_mounts)

Mounting plate for the pancake PCB or Timmit PCB common on v0 and other Printers for Ants.  

[CAN Toolhead Board Mounts](https://github.com/KayosMaker/CANboard_Mounts)

This link leads to a seperate repository.  Included in that repo are mounts for Sailfin that work with the Mellow SHT-36 board, as well as mounts for the BTT EBB-36.  Included are basic no strain relief mounting plates, as well as mounting plates with built in strain relief.
